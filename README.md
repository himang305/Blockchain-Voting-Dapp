# Blockchain-Voting-System
Here we have created a Voting Dapp where admin can start the election and add candidates while users can vote and see the results. We have used solidity for smart contract, Ganache for local Ethereum node, Metamask for payments and React.js with web3.js for client side interface. Whole project is build on Truffle.
